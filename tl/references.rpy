# - Character Sprites (ALL):
## All character sprites are made from photographs of physical toys owned by Moop UK/Kouda_Ha and then edited with
# the open-source software 'Krita' (https://krita.org) to give them different emotional expressions.
## Characters are dominantly made from Sylvanian Families toys. Most of the clothing is original Sylvanian Families clothing,
# and any other clothes were physically made by Moop UK/Kouda_Ha.
